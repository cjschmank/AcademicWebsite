Hello, my name is Christopher J. Schmank, PhD and I am currently an Assistant Professor and the Statistics Consultant for the Department of Psychology at Saint Louis University. During my time teaching at Saint Louis University I have taught two ungergraduate courses in Cognitive Psychology (PSY 3120) and Applications of Research Methods and Statistics (PSY 4060/4960). Additionally, I have taught several graduate courses in Applied Univariate Statistics (PSY 5790), Applied Multivariate Statistics (PSY 6500), and Psychometric Theory (PSY 5090). 

My **primary research interests** include:

1. How does regulating psychosocial stress impact language production and other cognitive abilities?
2. How does regulating emotion impact processing speed and other cognitive abilities?
3. How does healthy cognitive aging impact the experience of psychosocial stress and/or emotional regulation AND does this change the impact on cognition? 

Please contact me if you have any questions about my **research** or **teaching experience**! <br>
<br>
A **secondary research interest** of mine is: <br> 
<br> **User eXperience (UX) research, strategy, and design**! <br>
<br>
During my Ph.D. I completed an internship focusing on UX related research with Hit Point Studios in Los Angeles, CA. This experience paved the way for several other consulting positions which involved **competitive analyses** and **briefs**, **application quality assurance testing**, **in-person user experience interviews** and other forms of **UX data collection**.<br>
<br>
I also served as a graduate teaching assistant for the UX courses offered through the Applied Cognitive Psychology program at Claremont Graduate University (i.e., Strategy and Design, PSY 350UX; Usability Testing and Interaction Design, PSY 350UT; and User Experience Research Methodology, PSY 350UR).
