Introduction to R

Created by Christopher J. Schmank


Tutorial Overview

This OSF page was created to help undergraduate/graduate students who want to conduct statistical analyses in R Studio. Many undergraduate colleges are still teaching psychological science, experimental psychology, and other quantitatively motivated psychology students how to conduct statistical analyses ONLY using SPSS. More and more graduate schools have been shifting to using R/R Studio, which is free to download--unlike SPSS. It is the hope that this tutorial can be used and widely distributed to help students who are new to the R Global Environment acclimate to using R Studio in conducting statistical analyses.

Introductory Tutorial

This initial tutorial walks students through how to use Import Dataset feature of R Studio to generate code to load various types of data. Once data is loaded into R students are introduced to three different packages that can be used to generate descriptive and frequency statistics. Next, the students are introduced to how standardization of individual columns of data can be conducted in R and how this standardized information can be added to a dataset. Finally, this tutorial wraps up with a short 10-item Quiz.
