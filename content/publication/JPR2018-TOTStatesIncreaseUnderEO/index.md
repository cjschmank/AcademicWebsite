abstract: We tested the frequent assumption that the difficulty of word retrieval increases when a speaker is being observed and evaluated. We modified the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) so that participants believed that its evaluative observation components continued throughout the duration of a subsequent word retrieval task, and measured participantsâ€™ reported tip of the tongue (TOT) states. Participants in this TSST condition experienced more TOTs than participants in a comparable, placebo TSST condition in which there was no suggestion of evaluative observation. This experiment provides initial evidence confirming the assumption that evaluative observation by a third party can be disruptive to word retrieval.We interpret our findings by proposing an extension to a well-supported theoretical model of TOTs.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: Evaluative observation by a third party can be disruptive of language production based on the experience of more tip-of-the-tongue states during Trier Social Stress Test conditions compared to a placebo Trier Social Stress Test condition.
