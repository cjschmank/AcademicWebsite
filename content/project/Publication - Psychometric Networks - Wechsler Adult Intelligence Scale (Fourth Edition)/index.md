The positive manifold—the finding that cognitive ability measures demonstrate positive correlations with one another—has led to models of intelligence that include a general cognitive ability or general intelligence (g). This view has been reinforced using factor analysis and latent variable models. However, a new theory of intelligence, Process Overlap Theory (POT; Kovacs & Conway, 2016), posits that g is not a psychological attribute but an index of cognitive abilities that results from an interconnected network of cognitive processes. From this perspective, psychometric network analysis is an attractive alternative to latent variable modeling. Network analyses display partial correlations among observed variables that demonstrate direct relationships among observed variables. To demonstrate the benefits of this approach, the Hungarian Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Fourth Edition (H-WAIS-IV; Wechsler, 2008) was analyzed using both psychometric network analysis and latent variable modeling. Network models were directly compared to latent variable models. Results indicate that the H-WAIS-IV data was better fit by network models than by latent variable models. We argue that POT, and network models, provide a more accurate view of the structure of intelligence than traditional approaches.

At the outset of my doctoral program at Claremont Graduate University (Fall, 2017) my academic mentor, Andrew R.A. Conway, PhD. described psychometric network modeling as a complimentary and adventageous statistical tool developed that could be implemented in our research lab (https://caliberlab.wixsite.com/website).
