At Saint Louis University the first-year graduate students participate in two statistics courses across their first academic year--Applied Univariate and Multivariate Statistics.

The connected OSF page contains the various statistical tutorials for the Univariate Statistics course with a link to the Multivariate course. However, interested users can use the following hyperlink for direct access: <a href="https://osf.io/4ehyp/" target="_blank"> Multivariate Statistics OSF Page</a> 

Additionally, you can find the same information and tutorials by visiting my GitHub page. They are located in the PSY 5790 and PSY 6500 Repository Folders: <a href="https://github.com/cjschmank/" target="_blank"> GitHub Profile</a>
