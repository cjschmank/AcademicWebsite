As a user experience researcher I have conducted several applied research projects. 

One research project involved a meticulous user experience methodology designed to assess various aspects (e.g., luminosity, distance, and obstruction) impact on Augmented Reality gameplay. The methodology was produced by a colleague and user research was conducted together. Following our user experience research the company made changes to the game cards used in order to ensure that playability was not negatively impacted by general wear and tear or other non-game elements.

I have also been hired as a user experience consultant for several research projects where competitive product analyses were conducted and presented via executive data briefs. One project centered around a second Augmented Reality product geared towards urban planning and community outreach programs. For another project, competitive analyses were conducted looking at Extended Reality usage in hospital settings. Finally, my most recent consulting job centered around alternative substance therapies and extended reality to benefit mental health outcomes.
