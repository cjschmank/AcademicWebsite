The goal of this multi-study research project was the assessment of the psychological constructs of Crystallized Intelligence (i.e., general knowledge) and Fluid Intelligence (i.e., reasoning) data as well as novel data on adult Rationality (i.e., good thinking) among age groups of younger and older adults. This is one of the first online efforts to gather this type of individual differences data, and the establishment of the underlying structure of responses for both young and older adult participants would be a first for Intelligence and Rationality data of this sort. We were also interested in whether tasks that measure Rationality share more variance with tests of Crystallized Intelligence or Fluid Intelligence. Manuscripts are in-progress for this research.
