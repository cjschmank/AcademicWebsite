We are currently collecting data from young and older adult participants using CloudResearch. The main research project involves collecting Crystallized and Fluid Intelligence data alongside Rationality. This is one of the first online efforts to gather this type of individual differences data, and we hope to establish the underlying structure of responding for both young and older adult participants. We are also interested in whether tasks that measure Rationality share more with tests of Crystallized or Fluid Intelligence.
