At the outset of my doctoral career with Claremont Graduate University (Fall of 2017) I was afforded the opportunity to explore "Network Modeling." My doctoral graduate mentor, Andrew R.A. Conway, PhD. described this new technique to me as a potentially adventageous statistical tool that was recently developed that he wanted to start implementing in our research lab (http://andrewraconway.squarespace.com/andrew-conway). I was excited to start learning because one of the main reasons I chose CGU was to continue studying Cognitive Psychology while also focusing on various topics within Quantitative Psychology and Psychometrics.

This research project began with a small secondary data analysis project using the correlation matrix from the Woodcock Johnson Test of Cognitive Ability (4th Edition) submitted and accepted for poster presentation at the 30th annual convention of the Association for Psychological Science (File for poster (.pdf) available above). The next major move in this research project was the publication in the Special Edition of Journal of Intelligence "New Methods and Assessment Approaches in Intelligence Research" using the Hungarian Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Fourth Edition; File for publication is available above).  

This research project is currently still in progress as we continue to explore Cognitive Ability and Intelligence from a perspective that assumes a unified network of overlapping processes similar to the views expressed in Kovacs & Conway (2016).
