As human beings chronologically age we see relative declines in processing speed, executive functioning, inhibitory control, and working memory; however, despite these declines  in aging older adults are much more proficient at regulating their emotions and emotional behaviors. The current project was conducted to understand whether effortful emotion regulation, specifically the suppression of negative emotion, was more cognitively taxing for young adult participants (between the ages of 18-30) than for older adult participants (above the age of 60).  

Data was collected online using CloudResearch and Prolific. This dissertation project was completed as one of two side projects of the DARCI Project and functioned as my PhD dissertation research topic. Research question: Does aging impact the effect of Emotion Regulation on Processing Speed task performance? The impetus behind this research was that regulation of one's emotions, especially suppression of an emotional response, is a cognitively taxing process that involves constant monitoring and updating. Thus, while suppression of emotions occurrs subsequent and concurrent cognitive task performance should suffer due to shared mental resours. Also, since as this is an aging study I hypothesized different outcomes for older adults compared to young adults--specifically that younger adults would show greater degrees of impairment in subsequent cognitive tasks due to effortful emotion regulation usage.

Dissertation was successfully defended on April 3rd, 2025 and an eventual manuscript will be developed from the research.
